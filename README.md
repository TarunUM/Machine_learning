# My Machine Learning Experience

Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a beginner in machine learning and I'm excited to share my journey with you. In this repository, you'll find some of the projects and experiments I've done using various tools and frameworks such as Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, PyTorch, etc.

My goal is to learn the basics of machine learning and apply them to real-world problems. I'm also interested in exploring different domains and applications of machine learning such as computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, etc.

Some of the projects I've done so far are:

- A simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on features such as area, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.
- A convolutional neural network to classify images of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
- A sentiment analysis model to classify movie reviews from the IMDB dataset as positive or negative.
- A collaborative filtering model to recommend movies to users based on their ratings.

You can find the code and data for each project in the respective folders. I've also included some notebooks and reports to explain the steps and results of each project.

I hope you find this repository useful and inspiring. I'm always open to feedback and suggestions on how to improve my skills and projects. Feel free to contact me or open an issue if you have any questions or comments.

Happy learning! ðŸ˜Š
